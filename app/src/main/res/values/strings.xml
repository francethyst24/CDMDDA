    <string name="crop_desc_bell_pepper">Bell peppers (Capsicum anuum) locally known as “Alsal”, is a member of the
        capsicum family, which includes mild peppers, have a mild, sweet flavor and crisp, juicy flesh. According to
        foodfacts.com, bell peppers do not have a significant level of spiciness when compared to other peppers. Red
        bell peppers, as well as some yellow and orange types, are sweeter. Pepper plant seedlings should always be
        started indoors. To germinate, the seeds require the warmth of your home. Fill a seed tray halfway with seed
        starting soil or well-draining potting soil, then fill each container with one to three seeds. Place the tray in
        a warm location or use a warming pad to keep it between 70- and 90-degrees Fahrenheit. (21-32 C.) – the warmer
        the better. They are high in vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium. Bell peppers also provide a good source of
        fiber, folate, and iron. Bell peppers, in addition to being high in nutrients, provide a pleasant and
        low-calorie crunch with every bite.
    </string>
    <string name="crop_desc_corn">Corn (Zea mays) locally known as “Mais” is a large grain plant came from the grass
        family and a native to Central America, but it is now cultivated all around the world. It has six major types
        including popcorn, flour corn, dent corn, sweet corn, pod corn, and flint corn. This popular cereal grain has
        numerous purposes, but it is mostly used for culinary purposes. It is usually eaten boiled, grilled, and
        ingredients in cooking some of our favorite dishes. It has been also used to make corn flour, cornmeal, corn
        oil, corn syrup, tortilla chips, and other corn processed products. It contains dietary fiber, calories,
        carbohydrates, proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, and other nutrients. It has vitamins A, B, E, pantothenic acid,
        riboflavin, niacin, folate, and thiamine. It has minerals such as copper, potassium, iron, phosphorus, zinc,
        manganese, calcium, and magnesium. Corn plants are tall, therefore if placed on the north side, they will not
        cast shadows on other garden plants, reducing plant productivity. The ideal temperature range is 60 to 85
        degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures below 50 degrees F. Corn is not going to grow. Plants should be spaced 8 to 10
        inches apart. Plant hills 2 to 3 feet apart with 3 to 4 plants per hill as an alternative configuration.
    </string>
    <string name="crop_desc_potato">Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). locally known as ‘patatas\", is a root vegetable
        native to the Americas, with the plant itself being a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae. It includes
        high levels of vitamin B-complex as well as vitamin C. A potato has more vitamin C than other fruits. Potatoes
        also contain a variety of minerals, including potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and calcium. Every mineral
        has its own function in keeping the body healthy. Potatoes are also high in fiber, which gives you a sensation
        of fullness and aids digestion. When potatoes are cooked with their skins on, they retain the majority of their
        fiber. Potato can reach a height of 100 cm (40 inches). As the potato plant matures, its compound leaves produce
        starch, which is then transmitted to the tips of its underground stems. The stems thicken to develop a few or up
        to 20 tubers near the soil surface.
    </string>
    <string name="crop_desc_squash">Squash (Cucurbita maxima), locally known as “kalabasa”, is an annual herbaceous vine
        that can grow to be four meters long or more. It has a huge fruit with a yellow, meaty inside and is a popular
        vegetable in Filipino recipes like ginataang kalabasa and pinakbet. It is high in vitamin A, which is beneficial
        for maintaining eye health, boosting the immune system, and supporting cell growth among others. When producing
        squash, it is crucial to know that this food develops best in soils rich in organic material, according to the
        Agricultural Training Institute in the Cordillera Administrative Region (ATI-CAR). It is also fruitful all year,
        especially in areas with temperatures ranging from 18 to 30 degrees Celsius.
    </string>
    <string name="crop_desc_tomato">Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), locally known as \"Kamatis\", is a savory, often red,
        edible fruit that grows on a plant. Tomato fruit is consumed in a variety of ways, including raw, as a component
        in numerous meals and sauces, and in beverages. While it is botanically a fruit, it is regarded as a vegetable
        in the culinary world, which has caused some confusion. The tomato is a member of the nightshade family. The
        plants normally develop to a height of 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) and have a weak, woody stem that vines over adjacent
        plants. It is a perennial, although often grown outdoors in temperate climates as an annual. Tomatoes are a top
        source of vitamins A and C. It also has a lot of fiber, beta-carotene, iron, lycopene, magnesium, niacin,
        potassium, phosphorus, riboflavin, and thiamine. Tomatoes have low levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and
        salt. Moreover, unlike other foods, tomato cooking or processing (tomato paste, catsup, tomato soup, tomato
        sauce) is favorable to health. When tomatoes are heated, their cell walls break down, releasing more lycopene, a
        phytochemical that is beneficial to our health.

    <string name="disease_cause_bacterial_spot">The bacterium Xanthomonas campestris py.vescatoria causes bacteria leaf
        spot. It thrives in areas with hot summers and frequent rainfall.
    </string>
    <string name="disease_treatment_bacterial_spot">Once the symptoms of bacterial leaf spot begin to appear on your
        pepper plants, it’s too late to save them. However, if you take precautions before planting next season, you’ll
        have a better chance of preventing peppery leaf spot problems in the future. Crop rotation can help prevent
        bacterial leaf spot. Do not plant peppers or tomatoes in a location where either of these crops has been grown
        in the past four or five years. At the end of the season, remove all crop debris from the garden and destroy it.
        Do not compost plant debris that may contain the disease. Once the area is clean of all visible debris, till the
        soil or turn it with a shovel to bury any remaining bacteria. The bacterium is spread by splattering damp soil
        onto the leaves. Reduce the splatter by using a soaker hose and avoiding overhead watering. Stay out of the
        garden on wet days to avoid spreading disease on your hands and clothes. Bacterial leaf spot is also spread
        through infected seeds. Buy certified disease-free seeds and seedlings. It’s best not to save your own seeds if
        you’ve ever had a problem with bacterial leaf spot on peppers.

        maintain vigorous plant growth. Particularly, do not over-fertilize with potassium and maintain adequate levels
        of both nitrogen and phosphorus. Avoid working in plants when they are wet from rain, irrigation, or dew. Use
        drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to keep foliage dry. Stake the plants to increase airflow around
        the plant and facilitate drying. Staking will also reduce contact between the leaves and spore-contaminated
        soil. Apply plastic or organic mulch to reduce humidity and provide a barrier between contaminated soil and
        leaves. In the fall, remove or bury infected plants to reduce the likelihood of the pathogen surviving to the
        following year. For greenhouse production, early blight has been reduced by as much as 50% by covering houses
        with UV-absorbing vinyl film.

    <string name="disease_cause_late_blight">Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are
        fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi. There are many different strains of
        P. infestans. Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or
        the other.The host range is typically limited to potato and tomato, but hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium)
        is a closely related weed that can readily become infected and may contribute to disease spread. Under ideal

        Avoiding excessive handling of transplants. Bacteria can easily be spread on tools and on worker’s hands. Avoid
        handing transplant more than necessary, especially when wet. Choose, prepare, and maintain an appropriate field
        for planting tomatoes in soil that drains well. Remove voluntary tomatoes and from the fields before planting

        clothing, as well as insect activity. High relative humidity (more than 85%) paired with high temperatures
        promotes disease spread. Keeping this in mind, if you\'re growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, keep the night
        temperatures higher than the outside temperatures. Use only certified disease-free or treated seed when sowing.
        After harvest, remove and discard any crop trash. Between crop seasons, sanitize the greenhouse. To reduce leaf
        moisture, use fans and prevent overhead watering. Plants should also be staked and pruned to improve
        ventilation. If the disease is detected, use a fungicide as directed by the manufacturer at the first sign of

        prevention. First, choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or at least have moderate resistance to
        northern corn leaf blight. When you grow corn, make sure it does not stay wet for long periods of time. The
        fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop. Plant corn with
        enough space for airflow and water in the morning so leaves can dry throughout the day. The fungus overwinters
        in plant material, so it is also important to manage infected plants. Tilling the corn into the soil is one
        strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants.
        Treating northern corn leaf blight involves using fungicides. For most home gardeners this step isn’t needed,
        but if you have a bad infection, you may want to try this chemical treatment. The infection usually begins
        around the time of silking, and this is when the fungicide should be applied.

        and can eventually destroy it. Proper irrigation to avoid drought stress, as well as the removal of alternate
        grass hosts, are all part of the prevention strategy. Miticides, when used when economic thresholds are reached,
        can aid in the control of infestations and the protection of yield potential.

    <string name="disease_cause_target_spot">The fungus Corynespora cassiicola causes the disease. Target spot is
        frequently misdiagnosed in its early stages because the symptoms are difficult to distinguish and can be
        confused with bacterial spot and early blight.
    </string>
    <string name="disease_symptom_target_spot_1">The disease starts on the older leaves and spreads upwards.</string>
    <string name="disease_symptom_target_spot_2">The first signs are irregular-shaped spots with a yellow margin.
    </string>
    <string name="disease_symptom_target_spot_3">Spread to all leaflets and to other leaves is rapid, causing the leaves
        to turn yellow, collapse and die.
    </string>
    <string name="disease_symptom_target_spot_4">Spots also occur on the stems. They are long and thin. Small light
        brown spots with dark margins may also occur on the fruit.
    </string>
    <string name="disease_treatment_target_spot">Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease. Check
        all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots. Remove a few branches from the lower part of
        the plants to allow better airflow at the base. Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen,
        especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked. Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of
        the fungus. Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and
        infection. Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete. Practice crop
        rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.

    <string name="crop_desc_banana">Banana, locally known as “Saging” fruit of the genus Musa, of the family Musaceae,
        one of the most important fruit crops of the world. The banana is grown in the topic, and, though it is most
        widely consumed in those regions, it is valued worldwide for its flavour, nutritional value, and availability
        throughout the year. Cavendish, or desert, banana is most commonly eaten fresh thought they may be fried or
        mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. Cooking
        varieties, or plantains, are starchy rather than sweet and are grow extensively as a staple food source in
        tropical regions; they are cooked when ripe or immature. A ripe fruit contains as much as 22 percent of
        carbohydrate and is high in dietary fiber, potassium, manganese, and vitamins B6 and C.

    <string name="crop_desc_coffee">The coffee beans (Coffea) locally known as “Kape” you pour into your grinder every
        morning are the roasted seeds of the coffee plant. Coffee plants are flowering shrubs that produce berries.
        Though they’re called cherries, these fruits aren’t related to the kind of cherry you might put in a pie. When
        these cherries ripen, coffee growers pick them and process them, removing the fruit and letting the green coffee
        beans inside dry out. Before they get to you, a roaster typically buys those green coffee beans and roasts them.
        Now they’re the aromatic brown bean you recognize!

    <string name="crop_desc_rice">Rice, (Oryza sativa) locally known as “Palay” edible starchy cereal grain and the
        grass plant (family Poaceae) by which it is produced. Roughly one-half of the world population, including
        virtually all of East and Southeast Asia, is wholly dependent upon rice as a staple food; 95 percent of the
        world’s rice crop is eaten by humans. Rice is cooked by boiling, or it can be ground into a flour. It is eaten
        alone and in a great variety of soups, side dishes, and main dishes in Asian, Middle Eastern, and many other
        cuisines. Other products in which rice used are breakfast cereals, noodles, and such alcoholic beverage as
        Japanese sake.
